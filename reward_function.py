    @on_track (boolean) :: The vehicle is off-track if the front of the vehicle is outside of the white

    max 'x' value in the coordinate system.

    @y (float range: [0, 1]) :: Fraction of where the car is along the y-axis. 1 indicates
    max 'y' value in the coordinate system.

    as defined by way points

    radians (-180 degrees, 180 degrees)

    @progress (float: [0,1]) :: % of track complete

    @steps (int) :: numbers of steps completed. One step is one move by the car

    @closest_waypoint (int) :: index of the closest waypoint (0-indexed) given the car's x,y
    position as measured by the eucliedean distance
